### Features

- **Bun-Native**: Re-engineered to run exclusively on Bun.Purged all Node.js legacy dependencies (like `ws`).

- **Ultra Lightweight**: Optimized for minimal memory footprint (production tested at ~33MB).
- **TypeScript Native**: No build step required. Direct execution from source.
- **Stable & Updated**: Based on the rock-solid Shoukaku v4.2.0 logic.
- **Very cute (Very Important)**

## 📦 Bundle Size Comparison

| Package | Size | Dependencies | Total Install |

**89% smaller install size!** 🚀

## 🎵 The Story

Built out of frustration with constant WebSocket upgrade warnings that were 
making my Discord music bot laggy. After migrating to Bun, I realized the 
entire Shoukaku stack could be rewritten to be faster and lighter.

**Result?** Zero warnings. Noticeably faster. Way more fun to work with.

If this solved your problems too, [consider supporting the project](https://paypal.me/tuonome)! 
Even a coffee helps keep the motivation high! ☕
